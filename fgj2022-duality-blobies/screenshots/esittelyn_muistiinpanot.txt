no sound, so don't worry that you aren't hearing anything

runtime funtime diversifier
 * no assets
 * only code

programmer art at its finest

worst case for video compression

you can move
throw anti-blob bombs
and shoot lasers

throw anti-blob bombs to reveal the weak points

and shoot with the laser for massive damage

if you hit with the laser you can quickly shoot again
and additionally you acrue combo to increase your score

combo is visualized by zoom
and score is visualized how much of the background fractal you have pealed back

so yeah, i went hardcore with the "runtime funtime" diversifier. it was fun to invent ways around text.

and finally when you die, you can see how much score you had from the duration it takes for the fractal to scroll back
